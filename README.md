# hello-world
This is my first hello-world repo

I am interested in OSM and the promises of open data. I am a complete noob at programming but would love to get better. You can find my user page at: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:IanVG

I am currently just using github to plan and coordinate an address import for Athens-Clarke County.
